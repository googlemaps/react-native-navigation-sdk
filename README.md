# Google Maps Navigation (Preview)

## Description

This repository contains a React Native library that provides a [Google Maps Navigation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation) component.

The library is currenty in experimental state with a limited set of features available. [Turn-by-turn](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/tbt-feed), [Ground overlays](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/groundoverlay), and [Street view](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/streetview) are some of the main features that are not included but will come in the GA release.

## Requirements

|             | Android | iOS       |
| ----------- | ------- | --------- |
| **Support** | SDK 23+ | iOS 14.0+ |

* A React Native project
* A Google Cloud project with the [Navigation SDK enabled](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/set-up-project) and the [Maps SDK for iOS enabled](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/ios-sdk/config)
* An API key from the project above
* If targeting Android, [Google Play Services](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/overview) installed and enabled
* [Attributions and licensing text](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation/android-sdk/set-up-project#include_the_required_attributions_in_your_app) added to your app

## Installation

1. This repository is currently private. In order to install the library, you must authenticate with SSH first. See [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) for instructions on how to provide SSH keys.

1. To install the library run the following command from your project root: 

`npm install --save https://github.com/googlemaps/react-native-navigation-sdk#{version_tag}`

1. Follow the instructions below to add your API key to the appropiate files in your application project.

* Enable Google Maps SDK and Google Maps Navigation SDK for each platform.
  * Go to [Google Developers Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
  * Select the project where you want to enable Google Maps Navigation.
  * Navigate to the "Google Maps Platform" through the main menu.
  * Under the Google Maps Platform menu, go to "[APIs & Services](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/api-list)".
  * For Android, enable "Maps SDK for Android" by selecting "ENABLE".
  * For iOS, enable "Maps SDK for iOS" by selecting "ENABLE".

* Generate an API key at <https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/credentials>.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [Apply API restrictions](https://developers.google.com/maps/api-security-best-practices#api-restriction) to the API key to limit usage to "Navigation SDK, "Maps SDK for Android", and "Maps SDK for iOS" for enhanced security and cost management. This helps guard against unauthorized use of your API key.

For more details, see [Google Navigation SDK Documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/navigation).


### Android

1. Set the `minSdkVersion` in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 23
    }
}
```

To securely store your API key, it is recommended to use the [Google Maps Secrets Gradle Plugin](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/secrets-gradle-plugin). This plugin helps manage API keys without exposing them in your app's source code.

See example configuration for secrets plugin at example applications [build.gradle](./SampleApp/android/app/build.gradle) file.

### iOS

To set up, specify your API key in the application delegate `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.m`:

```objective-c
@implementation AppDelegate

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
  [GMSServices provideAPIKey:@"API_KEY"];
  [GMSServices setMetalRendererEnabled:YES];
  return [super application:application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions];
}

```

[!NOTE]Above code snipped also enables Metal rendering for Google Maps SDK. If you are not using Metal rendering, you can remove the following line:
  
```objective-c
[GMSServices setMetalRendererEnabled:YES];
```

## Usage

You can now add a `NavigationView` component to your application..

The view can be controlled with the `ViewController` (Navigation and MapView) that are retrieved from the `onMapViewControllerCreated` and `onNavigationViewControllerCreated` (respectively).

The `NavigationView` compoonent should be used within a View with a bounded size. Using it
in an unbounded widget will cause the application to behave unexpectedly.

### Add a navigation view

```tsx
    // Permissions must have been granted by this point.

    <NavigationView
        width={navViewWidth}
        height={navViewHeight}
        androidStylingOptions={{
            primaryDayModeThemeColor: '#34eba8',
            headerDistanceValueTextColor: '#76b5c5',
            headerInstructionsFirstRowTextSize: '20f',
        }}
        iOSStylingOptions={{
            navigationHeaderPrimaryBackgroundColor: '#34eba8',
            navigationHeaderDistanceValueTextColor: '#76b5c5',
        }}
        navigationViewCallbacks={navigationViewCallbacks}
        mapViewCallbacks={mapViewCallbacks}
        onMapViewControllerCreated={setMapViewController}
        onNavigationViewControllerCreated={setNavigationViewController}
        termsAndConditionsDialogOptions={termsAndConditionsDialogOptions}
    />
```

See the [example](./SampleApp) directory for a complete navigation sample app.

### Requesting and handling permissions

The Google Navigation SDK React Native library offers functionalities that necessitate specific permissions from the mobile operating system. These include, but are not limited to, location services, background execution, and receiving background location updates.

> [!NOTE]
> The management of these permissions falls outside the scope of the Navigation SDKs for Android and iOS. As a developer integrating these SDKs into your applications, you are responsible for requesting and obtaining the necessary permissions from the users of your app.

You can see example of handling permissions in the [app.tsx](./SampleApp/src/app.tsx) file of the sample application:

```tsx
import {request, PERMISSIONS, RESULTS} from 'react-native-permissions';

// ...

// Request permission for accessing the device's location.
const requestPermissions = async () => {
    const result = await request(
        Platform.OS =="android" ? 
            PERMISSIONS.ANDROID.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION : 
            PERMISSIONS.IOS.LOCATION_ALWAYS,
    );

    if (result == RESULTS.GRANTED) {
        setArePermissionsApproved(true);
    } else {
        Snackbar.show({
            text: 'Permissions are needed to proceed with the app. Please re-open and accept.',
            duration: Snackbar.LENGTH_SHORT,
        });
    }
};
```
