## Contribution process

## 1. Things you will need

- Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows.
- [git](https://git-scm.com) (used for source version control).
- An IDE such as [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- [addlicense](https://github.com/google/addlicense)
- [google-java-format Version 1.23.0](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) (used to format Java code).
- [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) (used to format Objective-C code).

## 2. Forking & cloning the repository

- Ensure all the dependencies described in the [README](./README.md) are installed.
- Fork `https://github.com/googlemaps/react-native-navigation-sdk` into your own GitHub account. If
  you already have a fork, and are now installing a development environment on
  a new machine, make sure you've updated your fork.
- If you haven't configured your machine with an SSH key that's known to github, then
  follow [GitHub's directions](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/)
  to generate an SSH key.
- `git clone git@github.com:<your_name_here>/googlemaps/react-native-navigation-sdk.git`
- `git remote add upstream git@github.com:googlemaps/react-native-sdk.git` (So that you
  fetch from the master repository, not your clone, when running `git fetch`
  et al.)

#### Create branch

1. `git fetch upstream`
2. `git checkout upstream/master -b <name_of_your_branch>`
3. Start coding!

#### Commit changes

1. This project uses `lefthook` to ensure tests pass before committing. Please configure your environment paths to include the Go binary path for `addlicense` and the Node binary path for `npx` in the `~/.lefthookrc` file. For more information, refer to the [lefthook documentation](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#rc).

2. `git commit -a -m "<your informative commit message>"`

    Please make sure all your check-ins have detailed commit messages explaining the patch.
    When naming the title of your pull request, please follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/) guide. For example, for a fix to the Driver library: 

    `fix(navigation_view): fixed a bug!`

3. `git push origin <name_of_your_branch>`

#### Create pull request

1. `git pull-request` (if you are using [Hub](http://github.com/github/hub/)) or
  go to `https://github.com/googlemaps/react-native-navigation-sdk` and click the
  "Compare & pull request" button

## 3. Test your changes

Make sure to test your changes before sending them for review. To do so, update and run the [Sample app](./example/) at `./example`.

## 4. Code Formatting

### Objective-C and Java Code Formatting

This project enforces code formatting for Objective-C and Java files to follow Google's style guidelines. The formatting is automatically checked before commits and during continuous integration (CI) using Lefthook and GitHub Actions.

#### Running Formatters Locally

Before committing your changes, you should run the formatters manually to ensure your code adheres to the required style:

**Objective-C:**
```bash
./scripts/format-objc.sh
```
This script will format all Objective-C files under the /ios and /example/ios directories according to Google's Objective-C style guide.

**Java:**
```bash
./scripts/format-java.sh
```
This script will format all Java files under the /android and /example/android directories according to Google's Java style guide.


## 5. Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

Please peruse the
[Typescript style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html), [Java style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html), and [Objective-C style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/objcguide.html) before
working on anything non-trivial. These guidelines are intended to
keep the code consistent and avoid common pitfalls.

## 6. Running tests

Google Maps React Native Navigation package has integration tests.

### Integration tests

Integration tests are responsible for ensuring that the plugin works against the native Navigation SDK for both Android and iOS platforms. Detox along with example application is used for the integration tests. "Integration tests must accompany the implementation of all new features.
To run the test you must first install and setup detox. Please follow the guide here:
https://wix.github.io/Detox/docs/introduction/environment-setup

Build the tests using detox-cli in the example folder:

iOS:
```bash
yarn run example detox:build:ios-release
```

Android:
```bash
yarn run example detox:build:android-release
```

Google Maps React Native Navigation SDK integration tests can be run with the following command:

iOS
```bash
yarn run example detox:test:ios-release
```

Android:
```bash
yarn run example detox:test:android-release
```

When adding new tests, you need to first add the detox part in the [e2e folder](./example/e2e) and then the actual logical part of the test in the [integration tests page](./example/src/screens/IntegrationTestsScreen.tsx) of the example app.
